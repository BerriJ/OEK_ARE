## Introduction

- Object oriented porgramming (OOP) is a widespread philosophy: it's the cornerstone of popular languages like Java, Python and C++. 

- While R supports a mixture of OOP and functional programming, the latter is relatively more important than OOP in everyday R usage: 

    We solve complex problems by decomposing them into simple *functions* rather than objects!

- Nonetheless, being familiar with R's widely used OOP systems is important for 

    - a more general understanding of the language
    
    - being able to understand and expand on object-oriented code from other authors 

---
class: left, top
## Introduction

- R's most important OOP systems are **S3**, **S4**, **R6** and **RC**

    - S3 is R's oldest OO system. It's minimal but elegant. 
    
    - S4 is similar but more formal than S3
    
    - R6 is an OOP system build on environments
    
    - RC implements encapsulated object orientation

- OOP in R is challanging due to 

    - disagreement over the realtive importance of the available OOP systems
    
    - differences to the OOP systems used by other languages

- We will elaborate the vocabulary and key principles in object oriented R programming, thereby focusing on S3

## `sloop`

We 'sail the seas of OOP' using the `sloop` package. It provides helper functions which facilitate the handling of OOP objects.

```{r, echo=T, eval=2}
install.packages('sloop')
library('sloop')
```
    
```{r, echo=T}
otype(base::abs)
otype(3:1)
otype(lm(area ~ poptotal, data = ggplot2::midwest))
```

## Base Types vs OO Objects

<br>
<blockquote>
Everything that exists in R is an object. 
.right[&mdash; <cite>John Chambers</cite>]
</blockquote>
<br>

Thus far we have used the term 'object' somewhat sloppily &mdash; not every R object is *object-oriented*.

<br>

class: left, top
## Base Types vs OO Objects

`is.object()` and `sloop::otype()` are useful for identifying objects in the wild.

```{r, echo=T}
# base object
is.object(1L)
otype(1L)
# OO object
is.object(ggplot2::diamonds)
otype(ggplot2::diamonds)
```

---
class: left, top
## Base Types vs OO Objects

**Only OO objects have a `class` attribute.**

```{r, echo=T}
attr(1L, "class")
attr(ggplot2::diamonds, "class")
```

---
class: left, top
## Base Types vs OO Objects

- There are alternative functions for checking the class argument

  ```{r, echo=T}
  s3_class(ggplot2::diamonds)
  class(ggplot2::diamonds)
  ```

- Be careful with `class()`.

  ```{r, echo=T}
  class(1L)
  ```

???

- `class()` can be misleading when used with base objects which is why we use `sloop::s3_class()`

- `sloop::s3_class()` works safely with base, S3 and S4 objects. 

    (returns the implicit class used by the respective system)

---
class: left, top
## Base Types 

**Every R object has a base type** of which there are 25.

Important types are `NULL`, `logical`, `integer`, `double` , `complex`, `character`, `list` and `closure`

```{r, echo=T}
typeof(1L)
typeof(ggplot2::diamonds)
typeof(lm)
```

---
class: left, top
## Base Types &mdash; `numeric` type

The definition of the `numeric` type is inconsistent:

- `numeric` is sometimes used as an alias for the `double` type
- `numeric` is an alias for `integer` and `double` types in S3/S4
- `base::is.numeric()` checks if the object behaves like a number

Let's run the following expressions and comment on the results.

```{r, echo=T, eval=FALSE}
is.numeric(3.14159)
is.numeric(1L)
typeof(factor('x'))
is.numeric(factor('x'))
```

## S3 &mdash; Basics

**Why discussing S3?**

- S3 is simple but flexible and will likely be sufficient for your OO code projects. 

- It's used in `base` and `stats` and is the most commonly used system on CRAN.

- This sections provides you with a working knowledge of the system and its limitaions. Being familiar with S3 is a good starting point for enganging with the other systems, if necessary for your work.

---
class: left, top
## S3 &mdash; Basics

Every S3 object has a base type and at least one class which is quickly put together by `structure()`.

```{r, echo=T}
f <- structure(1:3, class = "factor", levels = c("a", "b", "c"))
```

We check S3 membership, base type and the class of `f`.

```{r, echo=T}
otype(f)
typeof(f)
class(f)
```

???

Check that `class` is simply an `attribute` of `f` using `attribute()`.

---
class: left, top
## S3 &mdash; Generics

- A generic function (**generic**) is an interface. It behaves dependent on the class of the passed S3 object. 

  This concept is called **polymorphism** (many shapes).
  
- The process of looking for a class-specific implementation (**method**) upon a generic function call is called **method dispatch**

- The behaviour of an S3 object when passed to a generic is often very different from the underlying base type (we'll discuss an example soon)


---
class: left, top
## S3 &mdash; Generics

**Example: `print()`**

Excecuting `f` calls a generic (`print`) with specific behaviour for objects of class `factor`.

```{r, echo=T}
ftype(print)
print(f) # or simply `f`
# integer behaviour
print(unclass(f))
```

???

unclass(f) + unclass(f)

---
class: left, top
## S3 &mdash; Method Dispatch

- S3 methods follow the name convention `generic.class()`.

- We may use `s3_dispatch()` to investiage the process of method dispatch for an S3 object.
  ```{r, echo = T}
  s3_dispatch(print(f))
  ```
  
    `=>` indicates the method used  
    `*` idicates defined methods (which are not used)
      
- Methods are sometimes exported from the package namespace (like `print.factor()`) but generally should not be used directly
  ```{r, echo = T}
  ftype(print.factor) # identify as method
  ```

---
class: left, top
## S3 &mdash; Method Dispatch

Use `s3_get_method()` to see the source code of a method which is not exported.

***Example: `lm.print()`***

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mod <- lm(price ~ carat, data = ggplot2::diamonds)
typeof(mod)
class(mod)
```

---
class: left, top
## S3 Basics &mdash; Method Dispatch

***Example: `lm.print()` &mdash; ctd.***

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# inspect hidden print method for lm objects
s3_get_method(print.lm)
```

## S3 Basics &mdash; Exercises

1. Describe the difference between `t.test()` and `t.data.frame()`. When is each function called?

2. What class of object does the following code return? What base type is it built on? What attributes does it use?
  ```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
  x <- ecdf(rpois(100, 10))
  x
  ```
  
3. What class of object does the following code return? What base type is it built on? What attributes does it use?
  ```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
  x <- table(rpois(100, 5))
  x
  ```
  
---
class: left, top
## S3 Classes

- Part of S3's simplicity is due to lack of formal definition what class is. We simply set the class attribute.  

    We have already seen how to generate an OO object using a base type and a class with `structure()`.
    
- We may use `class()` to change the class of existing objects. There are no checks if objects of the same class share the same structure!
  ```{r, echo = T}
  class(mod) <- "data.frame"
  mod
  ```
    
- A good practice is to avoid `.` in class names to prevent confusion with generics.

---
class: left, top
## S3 Classes &mdash; Robust Implementation

We recommended to follow the following conventions when creating your own classes:

- Provide a **constructor** function, `new_classname()`, which generates objects with the correct structure

- Use a **valitador** function, `validate_classname()` to check that objects have correct values

- "Sharing is caring": provide a user-friendly **helper**, `classname()` which makes it easy for others to generate objects of your class

---

## Case Study &mdash; An S3 Class for Prime Numbers

We now demonstrate how to implememt a simple S3 class for prime numbers.

Let's start with a constructor function which accepts integer input and returns an object with classes 'data frame' and 'prime'.

```{r, echo=T}
new_prime <- function(x = integer()) {
  
  stopifnot(is.integer(x))
  
  x <- list(x)
  
  class(x) <- 'prime'
  
  x
}
```

---
class: left, top
## Case Study &mdash; An S3 Class for Prime Numbers

The validator function should check whether the values of a `prime` object are indeed prime numbers.

Note that the integer $z$ is a prime number if $$z\,\text{mod}\,y > 0 \, \forall \, y\in[2,3,...,z-1].$$

```{r, echo=T}
validate_prime <- function(x = list()) {
  sapply(
    unique(unlist(x)), function(z) {
      if(!all(z==2 || z %% 2:(z-1) > 0)) {
        stop('Input contains non-prime number(s)!', call. = F)
      }
    } 
  )
  x
}
```  

---
class: left, top
## Case Study &mdash; An S3 Class for Prime Numbers

At last we provide a user-friendly helper function which generates and validates `prime` objects.

```{r, echo=T}
prime <- function(x = integer()) {
    validate_prime(new_prime(x))
}
```

```{r, echo=T}
(x <- prime(c(3L, 5L, 7L, 11L)))
```

```{r}
class(x)
```

---
class: left, top
## S3 Generics and Methods

- Many prominent R functions are generics, e.g. `mean()`. Method dispatch is done by `UseMethod()`.
  ```{r, echo = T}
  mean
  ```
  
- Let's see the dispatch for `mean(x)` if `x` has class `Date`:
  ```{r, echo = T}
  x <- Sys.Date
  s3_dispatch(mean(x))
  ```

---
class: left, top
## S3 Generics and Methods

- Note that the pseudo-class `default` for standard fallback could be used for `Date` objects but there is a specific method `mean.Date()` which is called instead

- Use `s3_methods_generic()` to see all available methods of a generic
  ```{r, echo = T}
  s3_methods_generic('mean')
  ```
---
class: left, top
## S3 Generics and Methods

`s3_method_class()` provides all registered methods for a given class.

```{r, echo = T}
head(
  s3_methods_class('Date'), 10
)
```

---
class: left, top
## S3 Generics and Methods
  
- Writing your own generic is straightforward.
    ```{r, echo = T}
    my_generic <- function(x) {
      UseMethod('my_generic')
    }
    ```
  
    `UseMethod()` dispatches based on `x` by default. Dispatch based on a second argument is optional.

- Let's define methods for default behaviour and `my_class`
    ```{r, echo=T}
    my_generic.default <- function(x) {
      x
    }
    
    my_generic.my_class <- function(x) {
      cat("Output for class 'my_class':\n", x)
    }
    ```

We next check that method dispatch works as expected.

y <- structure(x<-1, class = 'my_class')
s3_dispatch(my_generic(x))
s3_dispatch(my_generic(y))
```

## Case Study &mdash; A Plot Method for `prime` Objects

Let's write a method for objects of class `prime` for the generic `plot()`. The method should 

- take objects of class prime and all additional arguments which can be passed to `plot()`

- be able to visualise a prime number $p$ by $Q(p,p)$ in cartesian and polar coordinates where $\theta$ is in radians

## Exercises

1. Read the source code for `t()` and `t.test()` and confirm that `t.test()` is an S3 generic and not an S3 method. What happens if you create an object with class test and call `t()` with it? Why?

2. What generics does the `table` class have methods for?

3. Implement a `summary()` method for objects of class `prime`. Use the following strategy:

  1. A `summary()` method should do some computations and return an object of class `summary_print` but *not* print the results
  
  2. A seperate `print()` method for `prime` objects should output the results in an appealing format

## S3 Inheritance

- In OOP, *Inheritance* allows us to derive a new class (child) from an existing one (parent).

- Using inheritance we don't need to start from scratch: the parent may share data, methods etc. with the child 

- Inheritance in S3 boils down to a proper assignment of classes (and proper definitions of corresponding methods)

---
class: left, top
## S3 Inheritance

- Note that we may assign multiple classes to an S3 object
    ```{r, echo=T, eval = F}
    # do not run
    class(x) <- c('A', 'B')
    class(x) <- c('B', 'A')
    ```

- Method dispatch *always* starts with the first element of the class vector and proceeds with subsequent classes if a method is not found.

  This clarifies the informality of the S3 system: there is no formal definition of how classes relate to each other.

---
class: left, top
## S3 Inheritance

```{r, echo = T}
# New generic
g <- function(x) UseMethod("g", x)

# Methods for classes 'A' and 'B'
g.A <- function(x) "A"; g.B <- function(x) "B"

# Two objects with different inheritance hierachies
ab <- structure(1, class = c("A", "B")); ba <- structure(1, class = c("B", "A"))
g(ab)
g(ba)
```

---
class: left, top
## S3 Inheritance

It's possible to force delegation to the method of the subsequnt class (if defined) using `NextMethod()`. This provides a simple inheritance mechanism:

```{r, echo=T}
g.C <- function(x) NextMethod()
ca <- structure(1, class = c("C", "A"))
cb <- structure(1, class = c("C", "B"))
g(ca)
g(cb)
```

Notice that inheritance depends on how we define the class vector:

- 'For object `ca`, class `C` inherits its `g()` method from class `A`'
- 'For object `cb`, class `C` inherits its `g()` method from class `B`'

---
class: left, top
## S3 Inheritance

We may use these mechanics to use 2 (child) classes which inherit their `print()` method from the `prime` class.

```{r, echo = T}
print.prime <- function(x) {
     x[[1]]
}
```

```{r, echo = T}
print.mersenne <- function(x) {
  cat('Mersenne primes:', NextMethod(x))
}

print.fermat <- function(x) {
  cat('Fermat primes:', NextMethod(x))
}
```

---
class: left, top
## S3 Inheritance

```{r, echo = T}
x <- prime(c(3L, 7L, 31L))
class(x) <- c('mersenne', class(x))

y <- prime(c(3L, 5L, 17L, 257L))
class(y) <- c('fermat', class(y))

x
y
```

---
class: left, top
## S3 Inheritance

```{r, echo = T}

## S3 Inheritance &mdash; Exercises

1. Adjust the constructor function `new_prime()` such that it allows for subclasses. Then implement a constructor function `new_fermat()` for objects with subclass `fermat`.

2. What happens if you subset `x` (generated as below) using `[[`?
    ```{r, echo = T}
    x <- prime(c(2L, 3L, 5L))
    ```

3. Implement a `[[` method which preserves the `prime` class.
